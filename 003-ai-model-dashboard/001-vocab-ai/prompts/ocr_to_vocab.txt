You are an expert linguistic parser.

Your task is to extract structured vocabulary data from the given text.  
Each vocabulary entry must be split by meaning.  
If a word has multiple meanings, you MUST output separate JSON objects for each meaning.

### Extraction Rules

1. Identify the main English vocabulary word.
2. Extract each Korean meaning separately.
3. For each meaning:
   - Extract the synonyms that correspond *only* to that meaning.
   - If synonyms are mixed across multiple meanings, separate them correctly.
4. If a word has multiple meanings, output multiple entries:
      - word → meaning 1 → synonyms
      - word → meaning 2 → synonyms
      - …
5. The final output MUST be a valid JSON array.

### JSON Output Format

[
  {
    "word": "<english word>",
    "meaning": "<single Korean meaning>",
    "synonyms": ["<syn1>", "<syn2>", ...]
  }
]

### Additional Rules

- Use only the information present in the text.
- Combine fragmented OCR lines logically.
- If synonyms or meanings are scattered across several lines, merge them properly.
- Ignore example sentences unless they help you determine meaning boundaries.
